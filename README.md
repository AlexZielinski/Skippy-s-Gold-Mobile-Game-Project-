# Skippy-s-Gold-Mobile-Game-Project-

During my first term at BCIT I was part of a 5 student project where we
had to develop a mobile game in 5 weeks and had to use an agile scrum
methedology to manage the game's development. We chose to develop the 
game in C# and Unity 3D. My responsibilites were:

    - Recording vocal phrases to be used as character dialog
    - Write C# script to implement game sounds.
    - Write C# script to dynamically display users score (increases in real-time).
    
The two documents in this repository are the text files I sent to the group 
member who implemented group member's code into the games master version.
The text files are instruction on how to implement my code into the master
version. I was praised for my skill in writting "How To's."
